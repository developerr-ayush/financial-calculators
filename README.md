# Financial Calculator Website Documentation

## Welcome

Welcome to the Financial Calculator website project! This guide will help you understand how to run the project locally, prepare it for production, and make the most out of its features.

### Getting Started

If you want to work on the Financial Calculator website on your own computer, follow these steps:

1. **Open your terminal.**
2. **Go to the project directory.**
3. **Run this command:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start a local server, and you can see the website by going to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Production Build

When you're ready to make the website public, use this command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist/` folder with the finished website ready for production.
